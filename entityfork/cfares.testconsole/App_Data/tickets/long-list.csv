Brad, 
Thank you so much for your help with this tour group.  They will arrive at your location between 12:30 and 1:00.  I will contact you when they arrive Friday to give you an exact count and then again when they leave so you will know they are on their way.  Sue Birchmore will have a lunch form she will give to you with information about their lunch.  Please attach a receipt (to be collected) to the lunch form and send it to my attention at the Corporate Office so that we may reimburse you for their lunch.
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thank you again for your help!

This group will tour the office from 10:30am - 11:30am and then come to your location for lunch.  They will arrive at your location between 12:30 and 1:00.  I will contact you when they arrive at the office to give you an exact count and then again when they leave so you will know they are on their way.  Vivian Jackson will have a lunch form she will give to you with information about their lunch.  Please attach a receipt (to be collected) to the lunch form and send it to my attention at the Corporate Office so that we may reimburse you for their lunch.  The lunch provided is listed above.  If they choose to have something different or in addition to what is provided, it would be a personal expense.  Otherwise, there is no charge to them for lunch.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jason, 
Would you be able to provide lunch for this group?  This a tour group that will tour the office from 10:30am - 11:30 am on December 10th and then come to your location for lunch.  They will arrive between 12:15pm  and 12:30pm.  The lunch provided is a CFA Sandwich, Chips and a small Sprite.  There is no charge to them.  If they wanted to get something different or in addition to what is provided, it would be a personal expense.  I will contact you when they arrive to give you an exact count and then again when they leave so you will know they are on their way.  Jane Wilkinson will have a lunch form she will give to you with information about their lunch.  Please attach a receipt (to be collected) to the lunch form and send it to my attention at the Corporate Office so that we may reimburse you for their lunch.
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thank you so much for your help!

Jason, 
Would you be able to provide lunch for this group?  This a tour group that will tour the office from 10:30am - 11:30 am on December 3rd and then come to your location for lunch.  They will arrive between 12:15pm  and 12:30pm.  The lunch provided is a CFA Sandwich, Chips and a small Sprite.  There is no charge to them.  If they wanted to get something different or in addition to what is provided, it would be a personal expense.  I will contact you when they arrive to give you an exact count and then again when they leave so you will know they are on their way.  Jane Wilkinson will have a lunch form she will give to you with information about their lunch.  Please attach a receipt (to be collected) to the lunch form and send it to my attention at the Corporate Office so that we may reimburse you for their lunch.
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thank you so much for your help!

This group will tour the Corporate Office from 10:30 am - 11:30 am and then come to your location at about 12:15 pm for lunch.  I will call you when they leave the Corporate Office to let you know they are on the way.  It will probably take about 30 minutes to arrive. They will receive a CFA Sandwich, Coleslaw and a Medium Sprite.   We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  If they would like to add to what is provided or change any of the items,  they would pay for those items on their own.  They will bring a lunch form for you to use for reimbursement on the day of their tour.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to me at the Corporate Office.   Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-765-8905.

Jason,
 
Would you be able to provide lunch for this group?  This a tour group that will tour the office from 10:00am - 11:00 am on December 1st and then come to your location for lunch.  They will arrive between 12:00pm  and 12:15pm.  The lunch provided is a CFA Sandwich, Chips and a small Sprite.  There is no charge to them.  If they wanted to get something different or in addition to what is provided, it would be a personal expense.  I will contact you when they arrive to give you an exact count and then again when they leave so you will know they are on their way.  Jane Wilkinson will have a lunch form she will give to you with information about their lunch.  Please attach a receipt (to be collected) to the lunch form and send it to my attention at the Corporate Office so that we may reimburse you for their lunch.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thank you so much for your help!

Would you be able to help provide lunch for a tour group on July 7th?  This group will tour the Corporate Office from 10:30 am  11:30 am.   They will stop by your location at about 12:15 pm to pick up their lunches.  They will take their lunches with them to eat at their school or at a park.  They will receive a  CFA Sandwich, Chips and a Small Sprite.  We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  The coordinator will give you a lunch form when they arrive at your location for you to use for reimbursement.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to me at the Corporate Office.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-765-8905. 
 
Thank you for your help,
Carisa Cooke

Tracy,
 
Would you be able to help provide lunch for a tour group on July 29th?  This group will tour the Corporate Office from 10:00 am  11:00 am.   They will stop by your location at about 11:45 am to pick up their lunches.  They will take their lunches with them to eat at a park.  They will receive a  CFA Sandwich, Chips and a Small Sprite.  We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  The coordinator will give you a lunch form when they arrive at your location for you to use for reimbursement.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to me at the Corporate Office.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-765-8905. 
 
Thank you for your help,

Would you be able to help provide lunch for a tour group on Thursday, September 1st?  This group will tour the Corporate Office from 10:00am  11:00am.   They will stop by your location at about noon to pick up their lunches.  They will take their lunches with them to eat on the bus or at a park.  They will receive a CFA Sandwich, Coleslaw and a Medium Sprite. We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  The coordinator will give you a lunch form when they arrive at your location for you to use for reimbursement.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to Carisa Cooke at the Corporate Office.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-765-8905. 
 
Thank you for your help,

Deirdre,   
Would you be able to help provide lunch for a tour group on Friday, October 21st?  This group will tour the Corporate Office from 10:30 am  11:30 am.   They will stop by your location at about 12:30 to pick up their meals.  They will take their lunches with them to eat on the bus or at a park.  They will receive a CFA Sandwich, chips, and a Small Sprite. We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  The coordinator will give you a lunch form when they arrive at your location for you to use for reimbursement.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to Carisa Cooke at the Corporate Office.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-305-3461.
 
Thank you for your help,

Kevin,

 
Would you be able to help provide lunch for a tour group on November 20th?  This group will tour the Corporate Office from 9:30 am  10:30 am.   They will stop by your location at about 11:00 am, to pick up their lunches.  Please let me know if it will be ok for them to eat at your location.  They will receive a  CFA Sandwich, Chips and a small Sprite.  We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  The coordinator will give you a lunch form when they arrive at your location for you to use for reimbursement.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to me at the Corporate Office.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-765-8905. 
 
Thank you for your help,
Carisa Cooke

I thought Id ask the MK group to meet at the restaurant in the CNN building at noon.  How does that sound to you? Would another time be better?
Thanks for arranging for that, Shelia.  I appreciate all you are doing to help this be a fun-first for all of us.

Lem,
Would you be able to help provide lunch for a tour group on March 12th?  This group will tour the Corporate Office from 10:00 am  11:00 am.   They will stop by your location at about 12:00 pm to pick up their lunches.  They will take their lunches with them to eat on the bus or at a park.  They will receive a  CFA Sandwich, Chips and a Small Sprite.  We will reimburse you for the lunch that is provided.  The coordinator will give you a lunch form when they arrive at your location for you to use for reimbursement.  Please sign and attach a ""to be collected"" receipt and send it to Carisa Cooke at the Corporate Office.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.  My number is 404-305-3461. 
 
Thank you for your help,

Laura,
Thanks for taking time in the atrium this week to talk about the Backstage tours.  I wanted to see if you could accommodate a group on June 19th at 2:00pm.  We are working on a contract with a potential data center partner and I thought it would be a good idea for them to go through the tour.  There would be 6 people from their account and potentially several of us staff members if this is okay.  Please let me know if this date and time works.
Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi Jacklyn,
 All is well as our members continue to sign up for our next Adventure Atlanta outing to Chick Fil A headquarters!
 As it turns out I will be out of town for our tour, but my co-chair Kari Wetche will be bringing our group to you on
 June 21st. Her phone number is 770-518-3317. Her email address is:kariwetche@aol.com. She will be in touch with you
 closer to the date, with a final count for our tour. I have sent her one of your original emails with the attachment regarding
 how the tours are conducted. I am sorry to miss this outing as I have heard from many how interesting the tour is.
 Have a great weekend!

 Subject: ACTION: NEED RESPONSE BY COB TODAY

Hey Monika: I hope you are well and having a good week thus far! 
Thanks for this info! We are excited to offer the HOBST to the Atlanta Fall Forum participants. 
 
As a recap, here are tour dates/time we confirmed that you would block out for Fall Forum: 
 
Tuesday, Sept. 25th  - Each tour will be approx.. 1.5 hours in length
1:15p, 2:30p, 3:30p  50 attendees for each tour; Total of 150 for the day
 
Wednesday, Sept. 26th FALL FORUM event day
4:00pm (as discussed, we will need a little grace on the start time should folks get caught in traffic)
 
We briefly discussed HOBST registration, however Kelley Sorrow raised the question if we should have them directed to the HOBST site on @CFA  to register or if we add the registration link for each tour time on our FF page for Atlanta attendees and then send you guys registration info 2 days prior (by Friday, Sept. 21st). 
Do you have a preference how we handle the registration? Ideally, Kelley would prefer we direct folks to the HOBST site so they can see all the info on the site.  
 
Due to deadlines with FF site work, we would need to add this info tomorrow. Can you let me know your preference and the best way to handle this by COB today? 
 
Thanks much! ~ Theresa
